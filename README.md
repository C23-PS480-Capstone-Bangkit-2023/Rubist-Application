### Featured Technologies
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studiogclid=CjwKCAjwp6CkBhB_EiwAlQVyxRlqEBd1HaF0B9PVKBPhUST26W_3W5vsPddfzTOr4kraMXGyVNtu0RoCBfEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) : Android Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used to develop Android applications. It is the official software provided by Google for Android-based application development.
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) : Kotlin is a modern programming language that was officially introduced by JetBrains in 2011. Kotlin is designed to be an expressive, concise, secure, and interoperable language with Java. It is designed to address some of the weaknesses and limitations of the Java language while maintaining compatibility with the vast Java ecosystem.
*	[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): Retrofit is an open-source library for Android application development that is used to facilitate communication with web services or APIs (Application Programming Interface). Retrofit provides an easy and efficient way to access and send requests to servers via the HTTP protocol.
* [Camera intent](https://developer.android.com/training/camera/camera-intents): Camera Intent is an intent in Android app development used to access the device's camera and take new pictures directly through the device's default camera app. By using Camera Intent, developers can integrate camera functionality into their apps without the need to develop their own camera features.
*	[Gallery intent](): Gallery Intent is an intent in Android app development used to access the device's media (image or video) gallery and select existing media files for use in apps. By using the Gallery Intent, users can select media files that already exist on their device, such as images or videos, and use them in the application that triggered the intent.


### Task for the Mobile Development Team
